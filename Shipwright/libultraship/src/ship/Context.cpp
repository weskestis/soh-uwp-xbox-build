// That is no longer true of the per-game half. `BeginGameSession` replaces the whole GameSession when
// a different game attaches, so the per-game guards below see nullptr and genuinely install the

//                   which one is decided by GameSession's record of what IT installed, not by a label.
//   SplitPending -- part per-game, genuinely not divided yet. Reported separately so unfinished work
//                   is never filed under "the design". CURRENTLY EMPTY: Audio and Console were its
//                   last two members and both are now split (Audio turned out to be engine state
