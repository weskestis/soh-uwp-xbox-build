// How the launcher process starts a game, without either side naming the other's symbols.
//
// A game core (OoT, MM) is a shared object the launcher dlopen's with RTLD_NOW | RTLD_LOCAL.
// RTLD_LOCAL is the whole point: OoT and MM each define Play_Init, Actor_Draw and 6,614 more
// colliding decomp symbols (claim C050), and RTLD_LOCAL keeps a core's symbols out of the global
// namespace so two cores can be loaded at once without fighting. The cost of that invisibility is
// that the launcher cannot link against ANY core symbol -- so the entire surface is the one export
// below, found by dlsym on a string, and everything else travels through the returned struct.
//
// This is the other half of zelda3d_hostiface.h. That header inverts libultraship -> game calls into
// registered hooks; this one is launcher -> game. Both exist for the same reason: a core is loaded,
// not linked, and only libultraship is shared by name.
//
// A core links against libultraship, so engine state is genuinely shared -- one window, one
// renderer, one resource manager (claim C054). Only game code is duplicated, and duplicate game
// code is exactly what we want private.
