 * stream (SDL3's replacement for the SDL2 queued-device API), then pushes interleaved
 * PCM samples in DoPlay() via `SDL_PutAudioStreamData`. It supports both stereo and
 * 6-channel (5.1) output depending on the AudioChannelsSetting configured in AudioPlayer.
 *
 * This backend is available on all platforms that Ship supports.
