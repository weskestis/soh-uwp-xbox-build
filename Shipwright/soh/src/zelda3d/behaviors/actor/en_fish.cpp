// Zelda3D behavior: En_Fish (ambient swimming fish) — animated model REPLACEMENT.
//
// Ground truth: N64 EnFish_Draw draws a 7-limb SkelAnime fish (gFishSkel + gFishInWaterAnim /
// gFishOutOfWaterAnim, OBJECT_GAMEPLAY_KEEP) via SkelAnime. OoT3D keeps the same fish in the keep
// zar, `/actor/zelda_keep.zar` under `fish/`:
//   model  fish/model/fishsmall.cmb  — 8 bones (a spine chain for the swim wiggle)
//   anim   fish/Anim/fs2_swim.csab   — looping swim (mirrors N64 gFishInWaterAnim)
//   anim   fish/Anim/fs2_jump.csab   — out-of-water flop (mirrors N64 gFishOutOfWaterAnim)
//
// All four scenes where the fish shows up in the render audit (Zora's Domain, Zora's Fountain,
// Gerudo Valley, Grottos) render AMBIENT SWIMMING fish; the out-of-water flop only happens to a
// fish Link has caught and dropped (a held/edge-case state, not in the ambient audit). So this first
// increment always plays fs2_swim. (Reliable swim-vs-flop detection would need to identify the live
// N64 anim — gFishInWaterAnim vs gFishOutOfWaterAnim — which isn't a stable pointer compare across
// the OTR load; left as a follow-up since the flop isn't a visible world gap. fs2_jump is present in
// the zar and ready when that's wired.)
//
// The fish's swim motion (wander, dart, flee Link) is shared N64 code that runs unchanged and just
// moves actor.world.pos + shape.rot; only the body-wiggle DRAW is replaced.
