// ZELDA3D_AUTO — programmatic actor replacement with auto-scale.
//
// Instead of hand-listing every actor, an actor whose loaded object has a matching
// OoT3D ZAR (kZelda3dObjectZars[objectId]) is replaced by that ZAR's main model, drawn
// via the same direct-GL path. The world scale is NOT a magic constant: it is MEASURED
// per object. The first time such an actor is seen, we let its N64 model draw and bracket
// that draw with the OTR_G_ZELDA3D_MEASURE opcode; the interpreter accumulates the actor's
// eye-space (== world-space) bbox and reports its HEIGHT back via Zelda3D_MeasureResult.
// scale = measured_N64_world_height / OoT3D_model_local_height (Zelda3D_AutoModelHeight, the
// bind-pose local Y extent). NOT a diagonal: the interpreter deliberately projects onto the view-up
// axis and takes the range, because height is what the manual scales were calibrated against and a
// diagonal carries an aspect-ratio bias (see the opcode in libultraship interpreter.cpp). This
// comment previously said "diagonal" on both sides, which is a ~1.5-2x systematic error in the
// reader's head even though the code was always right. The next frame the OoT3D
// model draws at that scale. Explicit sModelTable entries always win (they carry
// calibrated scale + anim resolvers) unless ZELDA3D_AUTO=2 (validation: route ALL through
// the auto path so the derived scale can be checked against the hand-tuned values).
//
// Gated behind env ZELDA3D_AUTO (0=off default, 1=fill non-table actors, 2=auto for ALL)
// + REPL `auto`. Static props only animate correctly (no skeleton); skinned characters
// come out in bind pose (frozen) — acceptable per the session-13 plan; sModelTable still
// drives the calibrated/animated ones at AUTO=1.

//   state 3 = STRUCTURALLY unreplaceable (no ZAR, no such CMB, model has no geometry, skinned with
//             n64anim off). Nothing about another scene changes this, so it is correctly permanent.
//   state 4 = NEVER GOT A MEASUREMENT. The bbox measure needs the actor's N64 draw to actually
//             happen; if the actor is culled or off-screen every frame we look at it, the measure
//             bracket never closes. `tries` therefore counts FRAMES WAITED, not failures -- an actor
//             that happens to be off-screen for its first 8 frames was marked unreplaceable FOR THE
//             WHOLE PROCESS, including in later scenes where it stands in plain view. sAuto is never
//             cleared, so nothing ever undid it.
// Splitting them lets the second kind expire at a scene change, which is the natural scope: the
// evidence ("never drawn while we watched") was gathered in one scene and says nothing about another.

// CMB-extent. That inference is only necessary when Grezzo RE-AUTHORED the mesh at different
// proportions. When the CMB is dimensionally 1:1 with the N64 display list -- which the Ice Cavern
// row already proved happens (a RED_ICE_SMALL instance derived exactly 0.06000 = sRedIceScales[SMALL]
// against a 1005-unit CMB) -- the ratio IS actor->scale, a number the engine holds EXACTLY and
// per-axis. Three height-primary misfires (King Zora's block, the Bottom of the Well coffin lid, the
// Shadow Temple guillotine) are all cases where one measured axis dissents from a value the actor
// already knows.
//
