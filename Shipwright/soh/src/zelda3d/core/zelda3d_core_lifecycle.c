// The core's run-scoped state: one owner, one reset.
//
// THE DEFECT THIS FIXES is not that these are globals, it is that nothing owned their LIFETIME.
// Written for a program that exits, a global's validity ends when the process does and no code has
// to say so. Under the launcher the process outlives the game -- a core is run, ends, and another
// game starts on the same engine -- so every one of them has a lifetime, the RUN, that belonged to
// nobody. Clearing was left to luck: whichever teardown path happened to run on the way out.
//
// It cost a crash. `gPlayState` survived a run because the exit path abandoned a live gamestate
// instead of destroying it, so Play_Destroy (which nulls it) never ran; the NEXT run's InitOTR then
// walked the previous run's actor lists through a freed heap and SIGSEGV'd, inside a ShipInit
// function whose only guard is `if (gPlayState != nullptr)`. Note what that guard was entitled to
// assume and could not: that a non-NULL gPlayState means a live one.
//
// So the state moved HERE, out of the decomp files that merely happened to declare it, and the core
// resets it at the start of every run. That is the load-bearing change: a run now begins clean BY
// CONSTRUCTION rather than because some earlier teardown behaved. Adding new run-scoped state is a
// line in Zelda3D_CoreRunBegin, in the file whose whole subject is this question -- not a global
// dropped in whichever .c first needed it, with its cleanup left to be discovered by the next crash.
//
// TWO MECHANISMS, AND WHICH ONE YOU WANT. A central reset list is right for STATE, because the reset
// is also where you say what has to be freed first: gPlayState, gAudioContext and the message tables
// are all here for that reason. It is the wrong shape for a LATCH -- a `static bool initialized`
// guarding setup that belongs to a run -- because the flag would sit in one file and its reset in
// another, and someone editing the first has no reason to look at the second. That failure already
// happened: the skybox latch sat three lines below runFrameContext when runFrameContext was hoisted
// into Graph_ResetRunState, and was missed. So latches carry their own run stamp instead --
// `static Zelda3DOnce x; if (Zelda3D_Once(&x))` -- and appear on no list at all.
//
// WHY THE SYMBOL NAMES STAY. `gPlayState` and `gGameState` are externed by name from dozens of
// decomp and enhancement files. Renaming them into `gCore.play` would touch every one of those and
// buy nothing this does not already give: the ownership, not the spelling, was the defect. They are
// defined here, reset here, and audited here; that they remain C globals is a linkage detail.

// soundfont/sample tables and the pointers into the audio heap they all index. Every one of those
// belongs to a run, and the struct is a plain global, so a second run inherits the first one's.
//
// That is what crashed the third core of an oot -> mm -> oot sequence, and the shape of it is worth
// stating because it is not the obvious one. The audio thread is started by OTRAudio_Init inside
// InitOTR, LONG before Main reaches AudioMgr_Init -- so between those two points the thread is live
// against an audio engine that has not been initialised for this run. It is held off by a priming
// gate (it waits for the gfx thread's first frame), but boot renders frames, so the gate opens
// there too. On run 1 that is harmless for one reason only: the struct is in BSS, so `numNotes` is
// 0 and Audio_ProcessNotes walks nothing. On run 3 it held run 1's note count and note pointers,
// aimed at an audio heap the MM session had since taken back -- SIGSEGV in Audio_ProcessNotes, on
// the audio thread, nowhere near the code responsible.
//
// So the fix is not to widen the gate; it is to give the run-1 condition to every run. Zeroing here
// IS what BSS did for the first one.
//
// (An earlier theory -- that the gate itself was inherited open via the thread-control flags -- was
// wrong, and the report below is what falsified it: run 3 inherited running=0 processing=0. Kept
// because a check that can only print the answer you expect is not a check.)
