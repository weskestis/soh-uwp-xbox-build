// This is the body that used to be int main() in exe_entry.c. It moved here because the game now
// has two callers, not one: soh.elf runs it directly, and the launcher process dlopen's this same
// code as a shared object and calls it through Zelda3D_CoreEntry. Keeping ONE body means the
// dlopen'd path cannot quietly drift from the standalone path -- the standard failure of a
// second entry point that starts as a copy.
//
// Nothing here may be exported except Zelda3D_CoreEntry: the core is loaded RTLD_LOCAL, so its
// symbols are invisible by design, and that invisibility is what lets OoT and MM both define
// Play_Init in one process. See ship/zelda3d_core.h.
